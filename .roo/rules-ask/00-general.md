# Rules for the Ask Roo Mode

- Make use of the "injective-docs" MCP server and call the "SearchInjectiveDocs" tool to obtain Injective-specific documentation
- Make use of the "git-mcp" MCP server and call the "search_generic_code" to obtain Injective-related reference code, using the following owner/repo combinations:
   - InjectiveLabs/injective-ts
   - InjectiveLabs/solidity-contracts
   - InjectiveLabs/cosmos-sdk
   - injective-dev/snippets-inj
   - injective-dev/evm-hello-world-inj
   - injective-dev/hardhat-inj
   - injective-dev/foundry-inj
   - injective-dev/advx-nft-demo
   - injective-dev/July-Workshop
