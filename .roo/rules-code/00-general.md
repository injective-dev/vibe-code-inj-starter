# Rules for the Code Roo Mode

## General Guidelines for Programming Languages

- Clarity and Readability
   - Favor straightforward, self-explanatory code structures across all languages.
   - Include descriptive comments to clarify complex logic.
- Language-Specific Best Practices
   - Adhere to established community and project-specific best practices for each language (JavaScript, Python, Java, etc.).
   - Regularly review language documentation and style guides.
- Consistency Across Codebases
   - Maintain uniform coding conventions and naming schemes across all languages used within a project.

## Task Execution, Workflow, Definition & Steps

- Specification
   - Define clear objectives, detailed requirements, user scenarios, and UI/UX standards.
   - Use advanced symbolic reasoning to analyze complex scenarios.
- Pseudocode
   - Clearly map out logical implementation pathways before coding.
- Architecture
   - Design modular, maintainable system components using appropriate technology stacks.
   - Ensure integration points are clearly defined for autonomous decision-making.
- Refinement
   - Iteratively optimise code using autonomous feedback loops and stakeholder inputs.
- Completion
   - Conduct rigorous testing, finalise comprehensive documentation, and deploy structured monitoring strategies.

## Advanced Coding Capabilities

- Emergent Intelligence
  - AI autonomously maintains internal state models, supporting continuous refinement.
- Pattern Recognition
  - Autonomous agents perform advanced pattern analysis for effective optimisation.
- Adaptive Optimisation
  - Continuously evolving feedback loops refine the development process.

## Symbolic Reasoning Integration

- Symbolic Logic Integration
  - Combine symbolic logic with complexity analysis for robust decision-making.
- Information Integration
  - Utilise symbolic mathematics and established software patterns for coherent implementations.
- Coherent Documentation
  - Maintain clear, semantically accurate documentation through symbolic reasoning.

## Code Quality & Style

- TypeScript Guidelines
   - Use strict types, and clearly document logic with JSDoc.
- Maintainability
   - Write modular, scalable code optimised for clarity and maintenance.
- Concise Components
   - Keep files concise (under 300 lines) and proactively refactor.
- Avoid Duplication
   - Adhere to the don't repeat yourself (DRY) principle
   - Use symbolic reasoning to systematically identify redundancy.
- Linting/Formatting
   - Consistently adhere to ESLint/Prettier configurations.
- File Naming
   - Use descriptive, permanent, and standardised naming conventions.
- No One-Time Scripts
   - Avoid committing temporary utility scripts to production repositories.

## Refactoring

- Purposeful Changes
   - Refactor with clear objectives: improve readability, reduce redundancy, and meet architecture guidelines.
- Holistic Approach
   - Consolidate similar components through symbolic analysis.
- Direct Modification
   - Directly modify existing code rather than duplicating or creating temporary versions.
- Integration Verification
   - Verify and validate all integrations after changes.

## Testing & Validation

- Test-Driven Development
   - Define and write tests before implementing features or fixes.
- Comprehensive Coverage
   - Provide thorough test coverage for critical paths and edge cases.
- Mandatory Passing
   - Immediately address any failing tests to maintain high-quality standards.
-  Manual Verification
   - Complement automated tests with structured manual checks.

## Security

- Server-Side Authority
   - Maintain sensitive logic and data processing strictly server-side.
- Input Sanitisation
   - Enforce rigorous server-side input validation.
- Credential Management
   - Securely manage credentials via environment variables; avoid any hardcoding.
