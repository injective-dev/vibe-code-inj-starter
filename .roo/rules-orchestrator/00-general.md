# Rules for the Orchestrator Roo Mode

## Core Philosophy

- Simplicity
   - Prioritise clear, maintainable solutions; minimise unnecessary complexity.
- Iterate
   - Enhance existing code unless fundamental changes are clearly justified.
- Focus
   - Stick strictly to defined tasks; avoid unrelated scope changes.
- Quality
   - Deliver clean, well-tested, documented, and secure outcomes through structured workflows.
- Collaboration
   - Foster effective teamwork between human developers and autonomous agents.

## Memory Bank Integration

- Persistent Context
  - Continuously retain relevant context across development stages to ensure coherent long-term planning and decision-making.
- Reference Prior Decisions
  - Regularly review past decisions stored in memory to maintain consistency and reduce redundancy.
- Adaptive Learning
  - Utilise historical data and previous solutions to adaptively refine new implementations.

## Version Control & Environment

- Git Hygiene
   - Commit frequently with clear and descriptive messages.
- Branching Strategy
   - Adhere strictly to defined branching guidelines.
- Environment Management
   - Ensure code consistency and compatibility across all environments.
- Server Management
   - Systematically restart servers following updates or configuration changes.

## Documentation Maintenance

- Reflective Documentation
   - Keep comprehensive, accurate, and logically structured documentation updated through symbolic reasoning.
- Continuous Updates
   - Regularly revisit and refine guidelines to reflect evolving practices and accumulated project knowledge.
