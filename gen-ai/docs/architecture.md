# Technical Architecture

## Introduction and Goals

TODO - Short description of the requirements, driving forces, extract (or abstract) of requirements.

TODO - Top three (max five) quality goals for the architecture which have highest priority for the major stakeholders.

TODO - A table of important stakeholders with their expectation regarding architecture.

## Constraints

TODO - Anything that constrains teams in design and implementation decisions or decision about related processes.

TODO - Can sometimes go beyond individual systems and are valid for whole organisations and companies.

## Context and Scope

TODO - Delimits your system from its (external) communication partners (neighbouring systems and users).

TODO - Specifies the external interfaces. Shown from a business/domain perspective (always) or a technical perspective (optional)

## Solution Strategy

TODO - Summary of the fundamental decisions and solution strategies that shape the architecture.

TODO - Can include technology, top-level decomposition, approaches to achieve top quality goals and relevant organisational decisions.

## Building Block View

TODO - Static decomposition of the system, abstractions of source-code, shown as hierarchy of white boxes (containing black boxes), up to the appropriate level of detail.

## Runtime View

TODO - Behaviour of building blocks as scenarios, covering important use cases or features, interactions at critical external interfaces, operation and administration plus error and exception behaviour.

## Deployment View

TODO - Technical infrastructure with environments, computers, processors, topologies.

TODO - Mapping of (software) building blocks to infrastructure elements.

## Crosscutting Concepts

TODO - Overall, principal regulations and solution approaches relevant in multiple parts (→ cross-cutting) of the system.

TODO - Concepts are often related to multiple building blocks.

TODO - Include different topics like domain models, architecture patterns and -styles, rules for using specific technology and implementation rules.

## Architectural Decisions

TODO - Important, expensive, critical, large scale, or risky architecture decisions

TODO - Include rationale for each.

### Use of Injective Technologies

Injective SDKs:
(insert description of how one or more of the Injective SDKs are used, or if not "None")

Injective EVM:
(insert description of how Injective EVM is used, or if not "None")

Injective native modules:
(insert description of how Injective `core` or `injective` modules are used, or if not "None")

Injective or EVM developer tools/ libraries/ frameworks:
(insert description of how one or more of tools/ libraries/ frameworks are used, or if not "None")

### Integration of Injective Standards

Injective Improvement Proposals (IIPs):
(insert description of how one or more IIP standards are employed, or if not "None")

Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs):
(insert description of how one or more EIP or ERC standards are employed, or if not "None")

## Technology Stack

TODO - List of programming langauges used

TODO - list of frameworks, libraries, and developer tools used

## Quality Requirements

TODO - Quality requirements as scenarios, with quality tree to provide high-level overview.

TODO - The most important quality goals should have been described in section "quality goals" within "Introduction and Goals".

## Risks and Technical Debt

TODO - Known technical risks or technical debt.

TODO - What potential problems exist within or around the system?

TODO - What does the development team feel miserable about?

## Glossary

TODO - Important domain and technical terms that stakeholders use when discussing the system.

TODO - Also: translation reference if you work in a multi-language environment.
