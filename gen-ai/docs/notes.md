# Notes

Use this file to keep track of any notes/ ideas while the gen AI is churning.
Especially useful for when you spot errors, or things that need to be changed mid-task,
as you cannot edit/ update them while doing so, because the gen AI is likely to:
- overwrite the affected files, or
- "remember" the pre-edited versions of the same files (retrieved from its context window)
